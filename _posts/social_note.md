I'm an awkward person.

I document this journey for others to know that if they are feeling socially awkward out there, they are not alone. And that it is a skill, and you can change for the better.

Mom gave example of giving out all cheery and generic response, and I can sense that. Then I always interpret mom's response as not correct anymore. And I do this to others.

My trigger is when I travel outside with others. I become tense and mind freeze.

I have to be competent in life, being able to handle life and all the adult duties. Because I am not going to be in my 20s for long. Once I hit 30, people won't see me as a twink boy anymore. If I plan to find partner by my 30, I will have to practice being and adult now. It takes years to develop. But also even now, when I hang out with people professionally, I'm already feeling the expectation to be somewhat an adult, able to handle situation, to plan for my future, to make decisions about life, to be aware of what's happening in society and have my own take on them. I won't be able to be the one who keeps asking basic questions all the time.
But, this doesn't mean that I will turn into someone who doesn't need others, or who is inflexible. I will show that I still rely on others, need their helps, wants their attentions, up for new adventures, down for other things.

I know that when I am in an intellectual conversation, I am distracted by being tensed up. When I was maintaining eye contact with TP, I felt as if I was being judged, as if he would watch anything I'd do or would say and judge me for it. I felt tense. And I think that I know now it was all in my head. TP had no reason to be on the hunt for my weakness. I am nothing for him to care. Yet I still think it that way. Everyone is on the hunt for my stupidity. 
Tip: it's ok to steer my gaze somewhere else, at least for a moment, relax, then re-engage.

At the climbing gym today, I was being a bit creepy. Helping is good, but keep feeling like I want to engage more yet not knowing how to and hence not doing it must have given a weird vibe to "Tag". When you act too excited towards a stranger, that is weird, to the stranger's eyes.

When I make a social mistake, I would feel like it's the end of the world. That people will find me weird, that they won't forget about what I did. That they won't like me afterwards. That this is why (in my head I think) I don't have friends. But I now don't delve in that mood for too long now. I can get out of it. I go back to the reality that I'm still talking to my friends everyday. That I can still have conversations with others. That I'm still hanging out with them. 
And people generally won't care about whatever personal things you make up for yourself. They only care when things affect them. So whatever weird thing you do, as long as it doesn't affect them, they won't care and it will be forgotten. The main thing is, don't repeat the same mistake. Then it becomes your reputation. A one-off thing will be taken as occasional glib. Repeating them means it's who you are. People don't want to be associated with odd other people.

Learn slangs!
- Catch you on the flip side = See you later. Slang among friends
Of course first thought: Is there an app for this??

One thing I know that when I feel overly-confident, I make mistakes. I say odd things. So when I feel high arousal, pause.

It is hard to learn how to converse with your coworker-friend in a casual yet professional/technically precise way. Technical conversation has formal vibe. You're trying to keep casual vibe with your friend. It's the balance between being friend and being colleagues while using English (non-native language). Aaggh it's hard!
If I'm good at having casual conversation even out of work context, at least I'll be well-versed in the method. Then in professional settings, I'll mainly only have to worry about the timing and context.

I haven't been living in an environment that encourages paying attention to small things in life. And I learn now that my attention plays a very important role in my ability to remember, and recall, experiences and facts. I thrive on feedback. I'm a reinforcement learning agent. How can I construct a living lifestyle/situations that gives me rewards in being able to pay attention to the details of life and general world knowledge? The Southwest trip with Sid really triggered my thirst for world (and a bit of life) and science knowledge. I feel like I have social rewards for it now. But I am still not finding paying attention to small details of life that important. I do want to, yet it doesn't click. Excelling at work still overwhelmingly dominating.

I have the tendency to take myself too seriously. I turn friends'/social activities which is supposed to be about fun but I make it like a test. For example, the way I discuss the sticky rice cake with Katherine made the thing feels like a task. I made self-deprecating comments about my mom's cake. I only discussed how to improve the cake, how to make it taste better, and then I think was making excuse for my mom. So I made it awkward, people don't want to make anyone else feel bad about themselves.

For some goddamm reason, I always keep up the guard with people I know for a long time. I act polite, and basic. It's like I can't build upon the casual moments and memories I had with other people. Every moment feels like a fresh start. But this happens I think only during one-on-one. So it's conditioned, not by default.

Advice:
-   **Don’t drag on** Basically, make it a habit to be brief and get to the point.
-   **Talk faster** Speed up the tempo of your dialogue if you know you talk slowly and pause often to gather your thoughts or process your own thinking; otherwise you’ll lose the listener as fast you as you can spell y-a-w-n.
-   **Avoid polarizing topics** To make a great first impression and draw others to you, stay upbeat in conversation and don’t bring up heated current events around race, religion, and politics.
-   **Show your emotions** Avoid being serious or speaking in a monotone -- display your emotions, laugh at people’s jokes (if they're actually funny), and be animated when telling your story.
-   **Be aware of body language** Smile at people, have an open and welcoming posture, make eye contact, nod your head to acknowledge understanding, and lean in (or forward, if seated) to show interest.
-   **Be a giver, not a taker** Some people show up with a taker mentality--hoping to get something from someone, rather than to add value to the interaction and serve someone else without the expectation of a quid pro quo.
-   **Approach every conversation with a growth-mindset** Come ready to learn from someone, rather than think you're there to impose your “wisdom” on the other person. Approach the conversation with an open mind and see the possibilities of engaging the interaction to grow and develop as a person.
- **Must not oversimplify things**: "if you're not sure about whether it's a date, consider it a non-date so you can act normal. The person should like your normal self anyway". This is an example of ending the conversation by giving a simplified answer.

How to remember what people say better: don't come with your own agenda and expand your attention span. Be an active listener.

When sharing a piece of knowledge to others, put it in context and state it as a comment. When I start with "I learned that ..." then it can sound like bragging, or trigger competitive mode in others. So instead of saying "I just learned that the Colosseum got its name from a 98-foot bronze statue of naked Nero 'Colossus of Nero' :))" I could say "Nero put up a 98-foot bronze statue of him naked, called the 'Colossus of Nero'. The Colosseum was not originally named that way but was built nearby so they named it after the statue lol". Or, to at least prevent competition mode, you can prefix it with "You probably knew this already but I just learned that ..."

Start collecting facts about your friends. Also write down memories with them. Recall those memories and tell them when you talk to your friends. People converse with each other casually by sharing past memories. Think of the car ride to Vegas in 3rd/4th episode of Beef for example.

I know that my tendency to use the wrong word or not quite make sense is high. It's because I don't think very precisely and my word to meaning translation speed is slow. Just have to keep working on it.

Dating. Meeting people for date brings out the communication and thinking quirks that I have. 
- When I tell people stories. I tell them with lots of filler words. But I just seem to list out itinerary, without really revealing anything about me. I would jump to a new thing that's sort of related but not really, either departing from my own story or from the story of other. It sort of shows that I don't really understand or have thoughts on what people just said. Then sometimes I switch topic and mention things that make me sounds like bragging off. I also tell things that doesn't seem to really have a point. I also make things up, and mix things up. The embodiment of all this was the way I tell story of my Southwest trips. 
- When I watch shows with other, I tend to pass judgy comments. And I have annoying behaviors such as jumping into conclusion and saying it out loud. I'm also not able to have a cohesive comment on an aspect of the show. I take too much time and pause to find the words and form my sentences and thought, if I have one at all.

- I am not able to describe myself clearly to others. I'd sound unsure (even about my own hobby). Or I would say things that doesn't really make sense. I am also not able to follow up with what others shared about their life. For example, my work, and music, and my hobbies. 
	- Side note: when I tell people I like Alt-J I always get a weird look back. And it's even more nebulous when I try to describe why I like them. Same thing for Schitt Creek and Fleabag. I don't know how to describe things to people with empathy. So the way I describe things sound strange to people.
- I realize I don't watch just-for-fun shows and comment on them that much.
